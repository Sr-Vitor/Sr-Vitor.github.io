## Overview

first of all, I tried to organize the classes by order of creation, starting with the container classes where all the other components were. But at some point, I got stuck on the design of the page. At the end I couldn't implement the responsive method without change the entire layout, even searching on google and I got stuck on this.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

How hard is it to be a beginner. In addition, I got more acquainted with the organization of the structure of the code, although I have to improve this part. 
But I'm still not ready to share. 



### Continued development

I had several difficult understanding how can i put a background image behind the background color like in the example of the desktop image
from the Frontend Mentor.

## Acknowledgments
What I could say as a beginner? ItÂ´s hard but keep trying. One day we will work on one project together. Let's dominate this world!

Note: It is important to say that everything I said may be grammatically wrong, as I am also improving my English. And just for that small part, I used a translator to make sure it was right. So give me a chance!
